# README
This project explores a dataset of customer spending data and preforms k-means clustering to identify patterns in spending behavior. The project first constructs several visualizations to investigate the distribution and variability of each feature. Then, the project uses the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters, k = 5, to minimize error within each cluster. Finally, k-means clustering is performed and the dataset is segmented into five distinct consumer groups. Of the five, three are relatively older in age: one such group earns little and spends little, one earns high but spends little, and one both earns and spends in the middle. The two remaining groups are both young and high-spending; however, one earns little while the other earns high. These distinctions are fairly well represented by a k-means model.
