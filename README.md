# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here you'll find the personal projects I've been working on throughout my growing data science journey. I'm constantly learning more, so check back often to see what new skills I've acquired! A brief summary of each project follows below.

## Projects

### [Legal Outcome Prediction](./Legal%20Outcome%20Prediction/)

- This project deploys a legal outcome prediction model
that predicts the verdict of class action lawsuits in the U.S. when provided a plain-text discription of case facts.

- **Skills Deployed:** natural language processing (NLP), deep learning, feature engineering, principal component analysis (PCA)

- **Frameworks:** Keras, Word2Vec, nltk, Flask

### [NBA MVP Finalist Prediction](./NBA%20MVP%20Prediction/)

- This project develops multiple supervised learning models to predict the top-five MVP finalists in any given NBA season.

- **Skills Deployed:** supervised learning, data cleaning & pre-processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), error analysis, data visualization

- **Frameworks:** sklearn, pandas, matplotlib

### [Customer Segmentation](./Customer%20Segmentation/)

- This project performs k-means clustering to identify segments in a consumer population.

- **Skills Deployed:** unsupervised learning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization
