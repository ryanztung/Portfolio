# README
This project uses 20 years of NBA statistics to predict the league's MVP finalists in a given season. Part one of this project reads and cleans three separate datasets that include general player, team, and MVP stastics since 1991. After merging all datasets together, the output is a cleaned dataset ready for modeling. Using this data, part two traisn two machine learning models to predict the league's MVP finalists based on player statistics. The project then develops a proprietary error metric to measure model performance and conducts backtesting to assess overall accuracy. Feature engineering is then conducted to further minimize the model's error. Finally, the model is fed a new dataset of 2022 statistics to predict MVP finalists at minimal error. In the future, more model tweaking is needed to refine the model predictions even futher.
