# Customer Segmentation

In this project, I explore a dataset of customer spending behavior and deploy k-means clustering to identify five segments in the consumer population.

## Results
Of the five customer segments identified, three are relatively older in age. One group earns and spends relatively little; another earns high but still spends little; the other earns and spends in the middle. The two remaining segments are both young and high-spending; however, one earns little while the other earns high. These distinctions are fairly well represented by the k-means model.
